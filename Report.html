        	<header>INTRODUCTION</header>
        	<p>I was curious about learning the html coding and making the website. My dream of making the website began after joining the NAMI college. Mark Zuckerberg was my influencer. I was unknown about coding  but my respected sir, Mr. Ankit Thapa helped me to secure my dream as a web developer by teaching HTML. He helped me to gain more knowledge about HTML. He has great sense of humor makes every classes interesting with interesting slides related to tutor. Fortunately, my past two month here have made me into a something of a coding. I can’t say "expert" because let’s be real.Many difficulties came during the learning time. I used to have difficulties to write a CSS for a html page and writting a correct tags in html page. But the regular pratice and activities assigned by university encouraged me to build my confident and made me able to develop a website by the help of HTML and CSS.<br><br>
